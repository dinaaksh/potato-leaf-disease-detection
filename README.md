This project is a potato leaf disease detection model. The current github repo contains the FastAPI service code as well as the frontend website using ReactJS. 
The FastAPI server was uploaded on cloud through render cloud free tier hosting (https://render.com).
The ReactJS app was hosted using Vercel free tier hosting (https://vercel.com/).
(The render server needs to be rebooted after inactivity)
